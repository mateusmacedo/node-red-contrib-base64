<script type="text/html" data-help-name="base64">
    <p>This function converts the selected property (default <code>msg.payload</code>) between Base64 and binary formats.</p>
    <p>If the input is a buffer, it will be converted to a Base64-encoded string.</p>
    <p>If the input is a Base64 string, it will be converted back to a binary buffer.</p>
    <p>You can also enforce encoding to Base64 or converting Base64 to a buffer, as needed.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Using "Encode to Base64" on an already encoded string will result in double encoding.</p>
